# code-snippets

Useful stuff (mostly). :neckbeard:

Note: this repo is left intentionally rough around (all) the edges, I'm making it public just for fun. Laugh if you want just don't blame me if you accidentally destroy something with any of these commands. :heart: :shipit:

## Some things I learned about...

* [Bourne-Again SHell (bash)][3]:bangbang:
* [Git][7]
* [Docker][2]
* [Postgres][8]
* [Domain Name Servers][4]
* [Python][5]
* [NetCDF4][6]

## Make life easier:
  1. Play in a sandbox.
  * Virtualize it, break it, repeat
  * Docker: container technology is generally useful - lightweight and works in layers, can help isolate problems and freeze environments (or just certain layers of the environment)
  * Virtual Machines using tools like VMware :money_with_wings: or VirtualBox
  2. When you find a way to do something, stash it somewhere that can be recalled and move on.
  3. Dependency management will consume you if you let it.
  4. Get really really good on a terminal; bonus points if you use [zsh][1]!
