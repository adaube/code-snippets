# code-snippets

A bunch of useful things that I want to reuse.

Note: this repo is left intentionally rough around (all) the edges.

Test things in a sandbox. No guarantees in life except things will break, just learn from it!

## Make life easier:
- This is highly generalized information
- Tools exist that take away a lot of the pain/negatives associated with each technology
- Knowing how and when to use specific technologies, and the best tools for the job, is something that comes with Paying Your Duesâ„¢ as a developer
- When in doubt, make things _less_ complex so you can move forward
1. Play in a sandbox.
  - Virtualize, break, iterate 
  - Isolate problems, freeze environments (or just certain layers of the environment)
2. When you find a way to do something, stash it somewhere that can be recalled and move on.
3. Dependency management will consume you if you let it.
4. Get really really good on a terminal; bonus points if you use [zsh][1]!

## Virtualization
1. Containers: when you need infantry
  - managed using tools like Docker, Kubernetes
  - lightweight, works in layers
  - fast, start and stop services quickly
2. Virtual Machines: when you need a tank
  - managed using tools like VMware :money_with_wings:, VirtualBox, Vagrant
  - slow, bulletproof (isolation)
  - heavy, requires dedicated resources (compute, storage, RAM) which makes it more robust
